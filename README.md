## Project Goals
I originally had this project to do a monte carlo simulation.  I investigated the data, I pulled up specific views on the variables I wanted to itterate over and found that the data was not what I had in mind.  I went back to the drawing board, I was frustrated, but I looked at the data further and found out what I could do next.  I made an application to help predict deductible amounts based on copay, coinsurance, allowed amount and amount submitted.  I also allowed the ability to filter based on State to allow further accuracy in predicting these amounts.  The goal of this project now is to have a functioning application that can act as a calculator for my company to find more accurate deductible amounts based on the parameters.  In this project I will learn how to import data into R and then clean that data into a readable and usable format utilizing data cleaning techniques and modifying the data for the specified task.  The data itself is fairly clean for the most part, been cleaned by one of our internals at work before it was stored within our database.  I don't anticipate the cleaning process to take long.  I intend to utilize simulation in the form of using a random normal distribution to make sure the numerical values are truly random for the linear model.  I will also check the new data to be sure it is in a readable and usable format that can be used for application development and testing in such a way that our development team will not have to clean the data or adjust it.  Documentation and commenting in this file will be something I will do so this process can be replicated and reused later if need be so the future programmer can understand my thought process and why I chose some paths.  This of course will be because the R program is written in a clean and efficient way and will have supporting documentation alongside it to further assist the future programmer.  


## Things that I am nervous about
I already hit one big speed bump being that I wasn't able to utilize a monte carlo simulation like I had hoped.  I did cross that bridge and pivoted the goals of this project to another functional purpose to provide for my company. I have been nervous and anxious on how to use R shiny.  It was the last lesson we learned in class and inovlves a deeper understanding of certain packages and syntax to utilize effectively.  The other challenge is working with the data set my company has provided me as I am not fully familiar with the health parameters since this is another department I have never worked with.  I am still excited to do this as I have always desired to do more statistical work with data in my career.  I am looking forward to doing this project to get back into data driven projects and within a program that is relevant to data science and a great way to see more of the data science world.


## **BIG GOALS**
My big goals for this project is to have something I can point to employers or other professionals as a good milestone or marker for my skills in R.  To also get more experience, wrangling, cleaning and modifying data in R, and then doing the analysis in it.  And become familiar enough with R that I feel confident putting it on my resume and then utilizing it in a day to day career.
