## Project Goals
In this project I will learn how to import data into R and then clean that data into a readable and usable format utilizing data cleaning techniques and modifying the data for the specified task.  The data itself is fairly clean for the most part, been cleaned by one of our internals at work before it was stored within our database.  I don't anticipate the cleaning process to take long.  I will use statistical methods to generate new data based on parameters given.  This will be achieved by using the monte carlo simulation which can be described in the link [here](https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/3/6-amazing-trick-with-monte-carlo-simulations). My goal is to utilize simulations and bootstrapping in R to generate this new data set, the end goal of this project is to use the simulation to generate patient synthetic data based off of health parameters.  I will import this data from my work's database and then isolate certain fields or columns to fulfill the requirements.  Once I have the new generated data set, I will perform further analysis on it to see if it is truly random such as generating summaries of the data to see if it is skewing towards one variable or patient attribute.  I will also check the new data to be sure it is in a readable and usable format that can be used for application development and testing in such a way that our development team will not have to clean the data or adjust it.  Documentation and commenting in this file will be something I will do so this process can be replicated and reused later if need be so the future programmer can understand my thought process and why I chose some paths.  This of course will be because the R program is written in a clean and efficient way and will have supporting documentation alongside it to further assist the future programmer.  


## Things that I am nervous about
I am excited to start this as it will be a good first step into my career as a data scientist but I also worry I bit off more than I can chew because I have never used a Monte Carlo simulation nor do I fully understand the math behind it.  The fact that it's also in R does make me slightly nervous because I am still learning this program and how to fully utilize it.  I did find quite a bit of supporting material to assist me in tackling a Monte Carlo in R.  The other challenge is working with the data set my company has provided me as I am not fully familiar with the health parameters since this is another department I have never worked with.  I am still excited to do this as I have always desired to do more statistical work with data in my career.  I am looking forward to doing this project to get back into data driven projects and within a program that is relevant to data science and a great way to see more of the data science world.


## **BIG GOALS**
My big goals for this project is to have something I can point to employers or other professionals as a good milestone or marker for my skills in R.  To also get more experience, wrangling, cleaning and modifying data in R, and then doing the analysis in it.  And become familiar enough with R that I feel confident putting it on my resume and then utilizing it in a day to day career.
