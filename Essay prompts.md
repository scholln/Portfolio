## How I have grown as a data person
Before this course, I had some minor experience with data analytics and working with data, I would describe it as very basic analysis and tasks.  Manipulating data in excel, making graphs, tables, etc.  Throughout this course, I have learned that I merely scratched the surface of what it means to work with data.  For example, in this course I have learned how to run simulations and generate new data based on given parameters and then making a new data set from that.  I learned about manipulating data into a more concise set like pulling certain conditions and then grouping them together and summarizing the results and then adding in a new column of data from that analysis.  I highlight these two things because cleaning data was something that I thought I knew how to do but just did very basic things like delete null entries or invalid entries, but it goes further than that like does this attribute fit more like an entry or row of data? Does this column need to be split into two different columns and how to do we do that cleanly and effectively? I always thought as someone who worked with data as someone who did complex analysis on a already nice and clean data set, but often times, these professionals have to clean it themselves and ‘wrangle’ it into a format that meets the need of their analysis or criteria.  I also mention simulation because this was my first introduction into analysis deeper than figuring out the average of a number, it was my first step into doing something different to data than what I am used to.  I was excited to take this project on because it let me use my math and statistic skills and do a project that produced something from a data set other than a numbers report and graphs.  


## Lightning Round
- I would describe the most difficult part of the class as the pivoting section from week 4.  That part was the most complicated for me because the idea or practice of transferring variables or keys was a hard thing to process because it required some foresight into how it would look once the operation was done, and trial and error.
- The easiest part of the class was user created functions from my experience.  I saw this because I was also learning user created functions in my python course at the same time and had a double dose of this idea.  The idea itself is straighforward, you ask for certain variables and then process give a result from those variables at the end.  Almost like running it through a machine.  You have a variable, you know what the machine does, you want the change the machine will bring to apply to your variable, and so you run it through the machine and get the desired change or result.
- The part of class that interested me the most was bootstrapping and simulation.  I always had a love for statistics and probability, it was a welcomed surprise when I saw this as a lesson we would focus on.  This should a strong functionality of R that other data driven softwares either lack or can't meet the level that R offers.
- I would say a piece of advice that I would offer someone just starting this course would be to think of ways you can apply the current lesson in your job, your project or find examples on why this lesson is important to learn.  The next thing I would encourage to do, is do the primers before class.  I say this because it does make a difference typing code vs reading code.  This will help you learn and practice the lesson.
