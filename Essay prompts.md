## How I have grown as a data person
Before this course, I had some minor experience with data analytics and working with data, I would describe it as very basic analysis and tasks.  Manipulating data in excel, making graphs, tables, etc.  Throughout this course, I have learned that I merely scratched the surface of what it means to work with data.  For example, in this course I have learned how to run simulations and generate new data based on given parameters and then making a new data set from that.  I learned about manipulating data into a more concise set like pulling certain conditions and then grouping them together and summarizing the results and then adding in a new column of data from that analysis.  I highlight these two things because cleaning data was something that I thought I knew how to do but just did very basic things like delete null entries or invalid entries, but it goes further than that like does this attribute fit more like an entry or row of data? Does this column need to be split into two different columns and how to do we do that cleanly and effectively? I always thought as someone who worked with data as someone who did complex analysis on a already nice and clean data set, but often times, these professionals have to clean it themselves and ‘wrangle’ it into a format that meets the need of their analysis or criteria.  I also mention simulation because this was my first introduction into analysis deeper than figuring out the average of a number, it was my first step into doing something different to data than what I am used to.  I was excited to take this project on because it let me use my math and statistic skills and do a project that produced something from a data set other than a numbers report and graphs.
